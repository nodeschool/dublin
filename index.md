This is a group dedicated to teaching people how to programme in javascript. We will mainly be stepping through the tutorials here [http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers](http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers) but we may go "off piste" if the feeling takes us there. N.B. This isn't a bootcamp or traditional school. We won't talk at you for the entire time and try to fill your brain with knowledge. We will try to give you the skills and advice that will help you become an awesome learner and programming problem-solver.
